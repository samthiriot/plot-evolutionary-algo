## OpenMOLE

[OpenMOLE](https://github.com/openmole/openmole) is a scientific computing soft 
dedicated to the exploration of the dynamics of simulations.
Among other features, OpenMOLE offers [calibration features](https://next.openmole.org/Calibration.html) based 
on [genetic algorithms](https://next.openmole.org/Genetic+Algorithms.html).

A genetic algorithm in OpenMOLE generates one CSV file per generation.

## Overview

The steps to visualize an OpenMOLE exploration are:
    - automatic in a RTask:
        - *merge* the various CSV files generated by OpenMOLE into one unique consistent CSV file
        - *package* the CSV file and the present visualization app into one zip,
    - manually:
	- *download* the zip containing the Shiny app and the data
	- *execute* the zip
